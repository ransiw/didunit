Description: Differences-in-differences estimates are calculated at the unit-level instead of the group-level, allowing for an expanded suite of aggregation methods, including on custom time-invariant variables. This builds on the work by Callaway and Sant'Anna (2021, <doi:10.1016/j.jeconom.2020.12.001>).
